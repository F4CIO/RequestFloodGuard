//    *** REQUEST FLOOD GUARD 1.0***
//    Detects brute-force RDC attacks in Firewall log and blocks found IP-s
//    Video presentation: http://www.f4cio.com/RequestFloodGuard
//    
//    This app will load all firewall logs from specified folder and detect attackers by running the specified query on those logs. Default query detects frequent requests on RDC port. It will then update or, if not found, create a firewall rule to block those attackers. Finally if attackers were detected it will send an email with the list of attackers IPs (and their rough location) blacklisted/added to firewall rule.
//    
//    Idea is to run this app either periodically or on every failed login attempt. If you run this app frequently (like every few seconds) app uses .state file to prevent running the app multiple times in parallel. If you run this app while it is already running, it will just schedule one more run and exit.
//    
//    If you run this app with -show argument it will just execute query and show result
//
//    Make sure to run it with admin rights. Маke sure to enable firewall logging in Windows Firewall settings.
//    You can ocasionally re-download .mmdb GeoIP databases but keep same file names:
//    https://db-ip.com/db/download/ip-to-city-lite
//    https://db-ip.com/db/download/ip-to-asn-lite
//    
//    Above is the default behavior but you can change configuration to identify any desired set of requests from Firewall log
//    or to modify Firewall rule that is being updated.

//Firewall logs (pfirewall.log, pfirewall.log.old, etc.) are loaded from this folder:
PFirewallLogFolderPath=c:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Firewall

//Field src_ip represents attackers IP. src_ip must appear in SELECT part. Some GeoIP data will be added for that IP. These are all fields that can by used in the query:
//date_ms INTEGER, date TEXT, time TEXT, action TEXT, protocol TEXT, src_ip TEXT, dst_ip TEXT, src_port TEXT, dst_port TEXT, size TEXT, tcpflags TEXT, tcpsyn TEXT, tcpack TEXT, tcpwin TEXT, icmptype TEXT, icmpcode TEXT, info TEXT, path TEXT
//Here is default query that will select all src_ip that have more than 5 requests to port 60555 with action ALLOW. Also this query ignores some IPs from local network:
//SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, src_ip FROM firewall_log where dst_port=3389 and action='ALLOW' and src_ip NOT LIKE '192.168.1.%' AND src_ip NOT IN ('0.0.0.0', '127.0.0.1', '8.8.4.4', '::1', '99.216.118.143') GROUP BY src_ip HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 ORDER BY src_ip;
//You should adjust this query to suit your needs. If you want to use different port, change dst_port value. Adjust IPs to your local network. Adjust request count treshold from 5 to your needs.
Query=SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, src_ip FROM firewall_log where dst_port=3389 and action='ALLOW' and src_ip NOT LIKE '192.168.1.%' AND src_ip NOT IN ('0.0.0.0', '127.0.0.1', '8.8.4.4', '::1', '99.216.118.143') GROUP BY src_ip HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 ORDER BY src_ip;

//If you are running this app periodically every X minutes set same value here. Use 0 to disable this time filter
